Need a place for the function to render headers of table rows, such as value, description, and required.
The number of rows will be determined by the amounts of the array items.
A prop called categories, which is an array, will be used to set the table structure.

From the length of the array items, we'll also get the number to set the number of rows.
This will ensure that the table dynamically adjusts based on the input data.

The function should be flexible enough to handle various header types and allow for easy customization of the table layout.
