Life's Journey

A winding path through joy and pain, Each step a chance to grow and gain. From dawn's first light to dusk's embrace, We dance our fleeting, mortal pace.

Love lifts us high on gossamer wings, While sorrow's weight new wisdom brings. In laughter shared and tears we shed, The tapestry of life is spread. Isn't this cool
