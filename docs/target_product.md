# target\_product Documentation

## Brief Description

target\_product is a JSON object that defines the structure and behavior for extracting product data from Target's website given a product ID (TCIN).

## Usage

This object is typically used as part of a larger system for web scraping or API integration with Target's product pages. It defines the query parameters, URL structure, and parsing options needed to retrieve product information.

## Parameters

* `tcin` (string, required): The Target product ID (TCIN) of the item you want to retrieve. Must be an 8-digit number.

## Return Value

When used in an API or scraping context, this object structure helps generate a response containing detailed product information from Target, including:

* Product name, brand, and ID

* Prices (current, regular, discounted)

* Product descriptions

* Images

* Specifications

* Ratings and reviews

## Examples

```javascript
// Example API request using the target_product structure
const response = await fetch('https://api.example.com/v1/realtime/ecommerce/target/product', {
  method: 'POST',
  headers: {
    'Authorization': 'Basic <YOUR_TOKEN>',
    'Content-Type': 'application/json'
  },
  body: JSON.stringify({
    tcin: '87973629'
  })
});

const productData = await response.json();
console.log(productData);
```

## Notes or Considerations

* This object is designed to work with Target's website structure as of the time it was created. Website changes may require updates to the query or parsing logic.

* Respect Target's terms of service and robots.txt when using this for web scraping.

* The actual implementation of request handling and parsing would need to be built around this configuration object.

* Always include proper authorization and respect rate limits when making requests to any API endpoint.
